# Bomberman
For now, I coded the game almost entirely, it needs adjustments to make it more challenging.
As for the menu, "START GAME", "PLOT" and "ABOUT" work properly, "HIGHSCORES" can be entered but will not show any scores and the "SETTINGS" menu may be entered and changed but it will not influence the LCD.
