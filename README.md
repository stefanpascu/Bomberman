#### 1. LCD
  It is used to display the menu and all the functionalities it posseses. It also presents during the game the following: player's remaining lives, player's score and the number of moves he is allowed to perform.

<br>
  
#### 2. Joystick
  It controls the entirety of the user's actions together with its two potentiometers and button. It allows the player to navigate through the menu and move throughout the led matrix while playing

<br>

#### 3. Buzzer
  It signals the player's moves throughout the LCD and led matrix and also brings new sounds when the player is rewarded or punished.

<br>
  
#### 3. Potentiometer
  It controls the buzzers volume, unfortunately it does not use a mapped value so it is not optimised for all its rotation.

<br>
  
#### 4. Led Matrix
  It displays the game during playtime and prints levels, the player and different emojis to reflect the player's actions
